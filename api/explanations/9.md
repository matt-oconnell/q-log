# JS: Passing References to Functions

We successfully mutate our object from within the function call. This is possible because `objects` are passed by *reference* and not *value*.

This allows us to modify the contents of the object.

One important thing to note is that if we attempted to overwrite our reference (i.e. `phone = {}`) within our function, we would be prevented from doing so. **We can only update the contents of our object**
