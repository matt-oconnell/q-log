# JS: String Comparisons

Strings are compared based on Unicode values. Every letter we use in a javascript program corresponds with unicode value. See [here](http://unicode-table.com/en/#basic-latin).

I'll admit, this is a bit of obscure trivia but you can see that answer `B` is the only option that will produce a false value as a capital `A` has a unicode value of 0041 while lowercase `a` has a unicode value of 0061. Unicode values are hexidecimal so if you'd like to experiment and see what values represent what characters you can open your console and type `"\u0061"`. Adjust the digits after the `\u` using any hexidecimal digit (1-10,a,b,c,d,e,f).
