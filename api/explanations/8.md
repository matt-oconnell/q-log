# JS: Passing Primitives to Functions

When passing primitives into functions, the function body has access not to the value itself but rather to a copy of it. When we decrement `bottles`, we are decrementing a copy of the `bottles` value. The copy resides in a seperate place in memory so the original `bottlesOfBeerOnTheWall` is unaffected by our attempts to manipulate it.
