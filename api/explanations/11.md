# JS: Variable Assignments and Scope

We've wrapped the main functionality of our function in an IIFE. This set the scope of out variables `a` and `b` to be assigned to the inner function, right? Well, not quite. The issue here is in the variable assignment.
 
 ```
 var a = b = 'Inside';
 ```
 
 This line does not actually break down to:
 
 ```
 var b = 'Inside';
 var a = b;
 ```
 
 Rather, it breaks down like so:
 
 ```
 b = 'Inside'; // -> This is a global!
 var a = b;
 ```
 
 If you are really trying to save space, the best you could probably get here would be:
 
 ```
 var a = 'Inside',
    b = a;
 ```
 
 Or:
 
 ```
 var a, b;
 a = b = 'Inside';
 ```
