# JS: Object References

## Primatives and Values

When we assign a primitive to a variable, we are assigning an immutable *value*. The value is guaranteed to be stored in a unique memory location. Observe:

```javascript
var a = 1
var b = a
a = 2
b // -> 1
```

We are essentially copying a value from `a` to `b`. Any changes made to `a` later on in the script will not affect `b` because we are assigning *values* and not *references*. The values assigned to `a` and `b` are always in unique memory locations even though initially it looked like we were passing the same thing around: `1`.

## Objects and References

Objects are manipulated by *reference*. This means that multiple objects can point to the same memory location. We can adjust a reference and affect all of the objects that refer to that reference.

```javascript
var obj1 = {
	val: 1
}
var obj2 = obj1
obj2.val = 2
obj1.val // 2
```

As you can see, the manipulation of `obj2`'s `val` property had side effects. Since both `obj1` and `obj2` reference the same object, changes made to either variable will affect the underlying reference object.
