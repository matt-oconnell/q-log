# JS: Object Assignment

Oh javascript, whyyyy?

Javascript object keys must *always* be strings. So what happens in the above code block?

We are attempting to assign an object as a key. Javascript sneakily converts this object to a string. So what do our keys actually look like?

```
Object.keys(myCoolObj)
// ["[object Object]"]
```

We have a single key: `[object Object]` that is getting overridden anytime we try and assign another object as our key. The last line `myCoolObj[key2]` was the last to do this, thus the value `Cool new value 2` exists as the current value for `myCoolObj[key1]`.
