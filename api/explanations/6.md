# JS: Primitives vs. Objects

## Primitives

**Remember this: JS Basic Types (Primitives) BUNNSS - Boolean, Undefined, Null, Number, Symbol, String**

**Someone on the Paleo/Primitive diet might eat burgers but without the BUNNSS**

Primitives in Javascript include all types which have immutable values, that are *not objects*, and have no methods.

But, what about when I call `('Hello').toUpperCase()`? It seems like there is a method on this string...

Actually, all primitives except for `null` and `undefined` have global object equivelants that wrap around the primitive values when necessary (known as coersion.) We can access the primitive value of those that were wrapped by the `.valueOf()` method.

The flow of this goes something along the lines of:

```javascript
var a = 1.23
typeof a 				// -> number
var b = a.toString() 	// -> '1.23'
```

During the execution of our last line, something happens behind the scenes along the lines of:

```
var tempObject = new Number(a)
var b = tempObject.toString()
```

* A temporary object is created by `new Number(a)`
* A primitive is returned and assigned to b by tempObject.toString()
* the temporary object is garbage collected
* `a` retains its primitive value


## Objects

Anything else that is not included in our BUNNSS acronym is an `object`. 

Objects are really just collections of properties. The values assigned to these properties can be of any type, while the property's key is limited to `Strings` and `Symbols`. 

Functions ARE objects. They are objects that can be **called**.
