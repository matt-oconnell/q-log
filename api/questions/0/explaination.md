# PUT vs. POST

PUT is *idempotent*, meaning: if the network is botched and the client is not sure whether his request made it through, it can just send it a second (or 100th) time, and it is guaranteed by the HTTP spec that this has exactly the same effect as sending once.

## How about some code?
```js
var React = require('react');
var Markdown = require('react-markdown');

React.render(
    <Markdown source="# Your markdown here" />,
    document.getElementById('content')
);
```

Pretty neat, eh?
